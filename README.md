# 🎨 Perspective Playground with Vue.js 🎨

Welcome to **Perspective Playground**, a fun and interactive space where you can play with perspectives and see things from different angles! This project is built using **Vue.js**, and it’s my very first Vue project, so join me as we explore the wonders of perspective manipulation. 😊

## 🚀 Project Overview

This playground lets you tinker with 3D transformations and perspective effects right in the browser, using the power of Vue.js! It’s a simple yet creative way to learn and have fun with CSS transformations and Vue’s reactive capabilities.

### 🎯 Features:

- 🎛 **Interactive Perspective Controls**: Easily manipulate the perspective, rotation, and scale of elements in real-time.
- 🎨 **3D Transformations**: Apply 3D transformations to your elements and see how they react to your inputs.
- 💡 **Vue.js Reactive Magic**: Leveraging Vue.js for a smooth and reactive experience.
- 🖼 **Beautiful UI**: Clean and minimal design to keep the focus on the perspective!

## 💻 How to Run It

Since we’re using Vue via CDN, all you need is a browser to run the app locally. No need to install dependencies or set up a development server!

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alzubair98/perspective-playground.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.
3. That's it! 🎉 You're ready to explore the playground.
